Simulation for Trust Management in Peer‐to‐Peer Networks Through Blockchain‐Based Machine Learning Anomaly Detection. The proposed algorithm establishes a detailed model for initializing trust metrics in a blockchain environment. By systematically collecting, pro‐ cessing, and analyzing data, it ensures an accurate and comprehensive trust assessment of participants. 
 # Algorithm Overview
This multi‐step algorithm incorporates the following steps:

## 1. Data Collection:

Gather all relevant data for participants, including:

• Total transactions

• Successful transactions

• Feedback ratings from peers

• Number of disputes resolved

These details can be extracted from the blockchain ledger and
external sources.

## 2. Metric Calculation:

Compute the following trust metrics for each participant:

• Transaction Completion Rate (TCR): Measures reliability in completing transactions.

• Average Feedback Score (AFS): Reflects peer satisfaction andinteraction quality.

• Complaint Ratio (CR): Indicates the frequency of complaints relative to total transactions.

• Dispute Resolution Success (DRS): Evaluates efficiency in resolving disputes.

## 3. Normalization:

Standardize all metrics to a uniform scale (e.g., 0‐1). Normalization
ensures fairness by aligning metrics with different scales.
## 4. Weight Assignment:
Assign predefined weights to reflect the significance of each metric
in the trust calculation.
After conducting empirical testing and analyzing the results, we fix
the weights for each parameter to optimize the performance of your
system. The fixed weights should reflect their relative importance
and contribution to the trust score.
